# Topic 
Youtube Comment Bot Analysis

# Project Details
The Clean Data folder contains a basic outline of the steps in order to preprocess and clean the comments from the YouTube dataset. I have cleaned the data for the Youtube comments grabbed by the API. 

The twitter folder is still in process. Did we want to use soley YouTube comments for this analysis? Twitter API Enhanced is not allowing me premission to collect tweets.
