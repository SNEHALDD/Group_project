      "\n",
      "      But, before talking about Jesus and the cross, we need to look at the problem of humanity, the problem every one of us is faced with. Despite the efforts of any person, we cannot earn our way to heaven. Romans 3:23 says: \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\". Anyone can examine themselves and know that even though, yes, sometimes we can do good, we also do evil at times. We commit moral crimes, and we rebel against God, which the Bible calls sin. We lie, we steal, we blaspheme God, and we can lust and have hate for our brother in our hearts. These are just some of the sins more than likely every person on earth has committed. God is loving, holy and merciful among other attributes but He is also just, perfectly just. Like any crime, sin has to be punished. If God did not punish sin, then He would be unjust. He would be corrupt. Someone has to take the punishment. Romans 6:23 says: \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\". This is talking about spiritual death, not physical death; if you die in your sins then you go to hell. There is good evidence that humans have souls. Near-death experiences are one of those evidences. There is a part of you that lives on past your physical body. \n",
      "\n",
      "      God sent His only Son to earth about 2000 years ago, His Son is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the promised Savior of the world. He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by coming to and being in our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was crucified on the cross as a payment for our sins. God poured out His wrath on Jesus in our place, meaning the justice of God is satisfied and sin is punished. While we were still at enmity with God, God still wants to save us, Romans 5:8 says: \"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\". Three days after Jesus was crucified, He rose again proving that His payment was enough and that He was who He said He was, the Son of God. There is real-world evidence for the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is not just a nice story.\n",
      "\n",
      "        Scripture tells us to repent, to put our trust in Jesus, and to follow Him as Lord. Repentance means a change of mind which means to turn from a life following sin to a life following Christ. Salvation is a free gift and it cannot be earned. No one can be perfectly moral on their own, it is impossible. This is the only way to be in the presence of God in heaven. It is important to reiterate that we cannot save ourselves; it is the gift of God for one to be saved. God is rich in mercy and ready to forgive, cry out to Him, be sincere when coming to God, this is not a flippant thing. Repent and place your trust in Jesus Christ alone, today is the day of salvation. Ephesians 2:8-9 says: \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\". Salvation is a gift. \n",
      "\n",
      "      There is no other way, Jesus Himself said that He is the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is not just a way, a truth or a life. Romans 10:9 says: \"That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;\". []\n",

However, the headphones were a necessity as this was technically a recording session, albeit in front of a live audience. The audience members had the same mix (essentially) that the band had in ours. So it was very much still a \"live\" experience - the headphones were used a monitors, as you would in a traditional studio setting, so everyone could hear the band and the band could hear themselves.', \"@Mark Lettieri I appreciate your response Mark.  I guess what speaks to me beyond the music is visually- seeing a group of people (musicians and audience) with headphones on enjoying 'live' music.  Live music should travel through the air and hit people in different ways. All those headphone make me think of the current state of humanity and how we all think we are taking part in community via social media but, to me, it just seems in the end everyone has their own headphones on and is checking out their own thing.\", 'Interesting. The title comes from the Trinity River, a river that connects the north Texas cities of Fort Worth, Dallas, and Denton - locations that all of the members of SP have either lived or played at some point. Sonically, the influences stem from a combination of Texas blues and rock, and Black gospel music - sounds that greatly impacted me as a non-native Texan who started his career here. That said, the song is probably one of the most \"connective\" I\\'ve ever written. I do enjoy 80\\'s action movies, however, which I don\\'t necessarily see as a bad thing.

Can't come behind a guy like that and not bring your Triple A game. Wanted to make sure he'd/those bands called me back. Game changer for me back then.

That’s a vintage jewel, and He and that bass sounds amazing! Furthermore, the quality of your instrument doesn’t make you sound better in the mix. Being a great player(as Mike is) and having great engineers(like we do) is what makes that happen. We could all play on junk and it’d still sound awesome! We’ve all done it before. And Btw, the bass sounds great, even on my air pod pros🤷🏽\\u200d♂️ Upgrade your headphones… Have a nice day🥳', 'Definitely can hear him. Upgrade your 🎧 man 😉']\n",

On iOS with non-Airpods/Beats you have to change Settings -> Music -> Dolby Atmos to Always On. Atmos mixes when streamed this way receive a special stereo binaural mixdown that only works with headphones, so if you force the setting and use something like your car stereo or bluetooth speakers it will be rough. To answer the original question, I listen with various Airpods and a 5.1.2 living room setup through a Denon AVR and Apple TV.\", '@Andy Grundman How did you listen to the mix?
