You are in fact, incorrect. \n\nA study results identified 73 (45.6%) of 160 incidents that occurred in areas of commerce.\r\nThese included businesses open to pedestrian traffic (44 [27.5%]), businesses closed to\r\npedestrian traffic (23 [14.3%]), and malls (6 [3.8%]). These distinctions were made in order\r\nto determine whether the public was more at risk in areas where pedestrian traffic was likely. \n\nSchools and hospitals were far less likely fyi\n\nAgain, you are basing conclusions on your bias, and finding conclusions to match your pre-determined conclusions. \n\n\nThe criminals were not criminals up to the moment they were driving their families. So again emotional judgment language distorting reality.', ""@David F Two armed men shooting at each other in road rage and killing their daughters doesn't change with training.  They were CRIMINALS!  They didn't shoot at each other because they were not trained that their not supposed to use their gun to commit crimes.  Training would not have changed their bad decision to use violence.  There's nothing emotional about my statement, it's a conclusion based on statistics.  Statistically, gunmen do not choose to inflict mass casualties in places where people are likely to be armed.  And, in the rare cases that they do, they are quickly neutralized.  Additionally, your anecdotal situation is not the same situation. That was a crime of passion, not a planned event."", ""@D Peterson That's not logic, that's feeling-based supposition. In Texas two armed men shot each others daughters in road rage, THAT is what armed untrained weapons in use will do. \n\nMadmen, are mad, don't reason like a reasonable person. A foundational fact you CANT seem to fathom. \n\nThe outcome of your scenario is that MORE untrained weapons would open up in hospital, and result far more probably in MORE tragedy! \n\nThis is called logic and critical thinking. Yours is an opinion in seek of a justification. \n\nYou claim do know why he targeted the hospital, with no supported facts, just supposition, and feel-good narratives. You may be right in this case, but you could be wrong as well. There is NO data to support your claim, just your feelings. \n\n\nThis type of fanciful thinking is WHY our nation is currently teetering on collapse."", '@David F If just 10% of everyone in that hospital had a holstered pistol in plain view, that madman would have never even tried.  Being armed is enough.  People who do this atrocities specifically choose soft targets like hospitals and schools.  Anywhere that they have the advantage and their victims are helpless.', '@Just Me You misunderstand me, the above was suggesting that being armed and ""trained"" is enough go out armed in public. \n\nThat sounds good, but as you know having served, people THINKING they are trained, and people being trained are two DIFFERENT things! \n\nI own a 9mm for home protection and target practice/recreation, but people thinking arming up and going in public is going to do anything OTHER than make the current gun violence chaos worse are not in touch with reality.']"
