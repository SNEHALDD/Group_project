UgyUrbvTj0TAhoOf4bV4AaABAg,Paul Hepker,1,"This band makes me soooo happy. This song in particular illustrates what can happen when 19 incredible musicians put aside their egos, and collectively make something so meticulously planned sound so incredibly free and spontaneous and joyful. 

This reminds me of my Brecker Brothers days, the days of Weckl and Pattatucci. And before that - of Michel Colombier‚Äôs ‚ÄúWings‚Äù. Or Klaus Ogermann‚Äôs ‚ÄúSymbiosis‚Äù, Miles‚Äô ‚ÄúBtiches Brew‚Äù. 

But how cool to record this album in front of a live audience? For the band and listeners to feed off of each other. Must have been ecstatic. (I hope I hear about the next one before it happens!)

This may be too slick for some, or too jazzy - but for me it‚Äôs Bach Escher G√∂del - these intricate lines interacting and mirroring and counterpointing, always compelling, always driving. 

This music of Empire Central is alive, and thriving. And heartbreakingly beautiful. Thanks for making me forget - if only for a moment - how lost and divided we are as humans. Capable of great harm and destruction, but also with such an innate capacity for cooperation and co-creation.

I'm just a nobody, but I like to share my point of view after comparing this with Glastonbury.

This sounds great, but it's too much, it's hard to process, in my case it's a lot more than my ears can catch, lots of instruments and musicians I can see but their sounds gets lost.

2 drummers, 3 percussionist, 4 guys on keyboards, cyntizaisers, samplers, 3 guitars; it's just overkill; no doubt they are a bunch of genios though.

What I found, though, was that most of the stuff I like has insane rhythm and drive, it doesn't have much on top in terms of equally interesting melodies.
Well, Dayum.
This track has all that!
I now see the difference between his solo stuff and his Snarky stuff; the horns are smokin' and his licks over the top add the cherry.

...but not all the time. When someone writes a great song, and then it gets arranged beautifully, when there's enough musicians to play the parts live, and when the recordists do an amazing job of capturing each instrument plus the sound of the room, and put that down faithfully on media?

Ugzrzn18TglaVfYU0tR4AaABAg,NeedGod dot com,1,"The gospel I would say is the main message of the Bible, it is the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and what He did on the cross for all of humanity.

¬† ¬† ¬† But, before talking about Jesus and the cross, we need to look at the problem of humanity, the problem every one of us is faced with. Despite the efforts of any person, we cannot earn our way to heaven. Romans 3:23 says: ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"". Anyone can examine themselves and know that even though, yes, sometimes we can do good, we also do evil at times. We commit moral crimes, and we rebel against God, which the Bible calls sin. We lie, we steal, we blaspheme God, and we can lust and have hate for our brother in our hearts. These are just some of the sins more than likely every person on earth has committed. God is loving, holy and merciful among other attributes but He is also just, perfectly just. Like any crime, sin has to be punished. If God did not punish sin, then He would be unjust. He would be corrupt. Someone has to take the punishment. Romans 6:23 says: ""For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."". This is talking about spiritual death, not physical death; if you die in your sins then you go to hell. There is good evidence that humans have souls. Near-death experiences are one of those evidences. There is a part of you that lives on past your physical body.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬† God sent His only Son to earth about 2000 years ago, His Son is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the promised Savior of the world. He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by coming to and being in our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was crucified on the cross as a payment for our sins. God poured out His wrath on Jesus in our place, meaning the justice of God is satisfied and sin is punished. While we were still at enmity with God, God still wants to save us, Romans 5:8 says: ""But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."". Three days after Jesus was crucified, He rose again proving that His payment was enough and that He was who He said He was, the Son of God. There is real-world evidence for the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is not just a nice story.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Scripture tells us to repent, to put our trust in Jesus, and to follow Him as Lord. Repentance means a change of mind which means to turn from a life following sin to a life following Christ. Salvation is a free gift and it cannot be earned. No one can be perfectly moral on their own, it is impossible. This is the only way to be in the presence of God in heaven. It is important to reiterate that we cannot save ourselves; it is the gift of God for one to be saved. God is rich in mercy and ready to forgive, cry out to Him, be sincere when coming to God, this is not a flippant thing. Repent and place your trust in Jesus Christ alone, today is the day of salvation. Ephesians 2:8-9 says: ""For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."". Salvation is a gift.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬† There is no other way, Jesus Himself said that He is the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is not just a way, a truth or a life. Romans 10:9 says: ""That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;"".",0,[]

For instance- It sound like a soundtrack from an 80""s action film.  
What does this music say about  America today and whats happening in our country?  Its seems like its nostalgia instead of saying something in music to connect people .   
Great playing though...",3,"['@Lowness Funk Right on, and I see your point. However, the headphones were a necessity as this was technically a recording session, albeit in front of a live audience. The audience members had the same mix (essentially) that the band had in ours. So it was very much still a ""live"" experience - the headphones were used a monitors, as you would in a traditional studio setting, so everyone could hear the band and the band could hear themselves.', ""@Mark Lettieri I appreciate your response Mark.  I guess what speaks to me beyond the music is visually- seeing a group of people (musicians and audience) with headphones on enjoying 'live' music.  Live music should travel through the air and hit people in different ways. All those headphone make me think of the current state of humanity and how we all think we are taking part in community via social media but, to me, it just seems in the end everyone has their own headphones on and is checking out their own thing."", 'Interesting. The title comes from the Trinity River, a river that connects the north Texas cities of Fort Worth, Dallas, and Denton - locations that all of the members of SP have either lived or played at some point. Sonically, the influences stem from a combination of Texas blues and rock, and Black gospel music - sounds that greatly impacted me as a non-native Texan who started his career here. That said, the song is probably one of the most ""connective"" I\'ve ever written. I do enjoy 80\'s action movies, however, which I don\'t necessarily see as a bad thing. But being that it\'s instrumental music, people will hear what they want to in it...Thanks for listening.']"

Being redundant means no longer useful or needed. In our case, our reason is about more musical layers and options to serve or create something unique within the music. Instead of thinking it\'s redundant to have 3 percussionists or 3 drummers, Listen to what we were able to do with it. Do we need multiple guitarists/drummers/perc players etc.... No. But again, the focus or reason isn\'t about ""do you need"" rather it\'s about, what could you do if you have those extra layers and musical options? If it\'s about ""creating"" then who\'s to say what you do or don\'t need...']"

Sencond, I was looking forward to hearing new stuff ever since their last album came out.
Third, having Larnell on board is a big win for any band - he is my favorite drummer. 

I also am going to see them on 17th of October this year. Already saw them once in 2019, which was easily my favorite concert I have ever been to, and I have been to lots of them.
