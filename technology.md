# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

### Pandas 
Will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis.

### Python 
For further analysis

## Database Storage

### PostGresSQL
Since we are dealing with social media comments, a relational database management system is ideal


## Machine Learning
### SciKitLearn
For document-focused classification, we are using Naive Bayes - MultinomialNB
 - Has a historical use in spam filtration and document categorization
 - Will look for probability of each class when comments are inputed
### Training and Testing Setup
 - Split data into training and testing sets
 - Use CountVectorizer to describe term frequencies from our comment collections (document-term matrices)
 - Use Naive Bayes to make predictions for testing set


## Dashboard
### Tableau(?)


### DS.js(?)
